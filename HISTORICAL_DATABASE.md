## Analytics Usage

### NBA Player Props Analysis

```python
from analytics.betting_analytics import get_analytics

analytics = get_analytics()

# Get comprehensive player prop analysis
props = analytics.get_player_prop_analysis("LeBron James", "points", 25.5)

print(f"Overall: {props['overall']['avg']} avg, {props['overall']['over_rate']}% over rate")
print(f"Home: {props['home']['avg']} avg, {props['home']['over_rate']}% over rate")
print(f"Away: {props['away']['avg']} avg, {props['away']['over_rate']}% over rate")
print(f"Last 5: {props['last_5']['avg']} avg, trend: {props['last_5']['trend']}")

analytics.close()
```

Result:
```python
{
    "overall": {"avg": 27.3, "over_rate": 68.2, "games": 45},
    "home": {"avg": 28.1, "over_rate": 72.0, "games": 22},
    "away": {"avg": 26.5, "over_rate": 64.3, "games": 23},
    "last_5": {"avg": 29.2, "over_rate": 80.0, "trend": "UP"},
    "last_10": {"avg": 28.5, "over_rate": 75.0}
}
```

### Soccer BTTS Analysis

```python
from analytics.betting_analytics import get_analytics

analytics = get_analytics()

# Get team BTTS analysis
btts = analytics.get_team_btts_analysis("Liverpool", "eng.1")

print(f"Overall BTTS Rate: {btts['overall']['rate']}%")
print(f"Home BTTS Rate: {btts['home']['rate']}%")
print(f"Away BTTS Rate: {btts['away']['rate']}%")
print(f"Trend: {btts['trend']}")

analytics.close()
```

Result:
```python
{
    "overall": {"rate": 58.0, "games": 24},
    "home": {"rate": 65.0, "games": 12},
    "away": {"rate": 50.0, "games": 12},
    "trend": "UP"
}
```

### Esports Map Analysis

```python
from analytics.betting_analytics import get_analytics

analytics = get_analytics()

# Get team map statistics
maps = analytics.get_team_map_stats("Sentinels", "valorant")

for map_name, stats in maps.items():
    print(f"{map_name}: {stats['win_rate']}% win rate ({stats['won']}/{stats['played']})")

analytics.close()
```

Result:
```python
{
    "ascent": {"played": 15, "won": 12, "win_rate": 80.0},
    "bind": {"played": 10, "won": 7, "win_rate": 70.0},
    "haven": {"played": 8, "won": 3, "win_rate": 37.5}
}
```

### Value Bets Query

```python
from analytics.betting_analytics import get_analytics

analytics = get_analytics()

# Get current value bets
value_bets = analytics.get_value_bets("nba", min_edge=5.0)

for bet in value_bets:
    print(f"Match: {bet['match']}")
    print(f"Selection: {bet['selection']}")
    print(f"Edge: {bet['edge']:.1f}%")
    print(f"Confidence: {bet['confidence']:.2f}")
    print("-" * 50)

analytics.close()
```

## Database Initialization

```python
from database.db import init_db

# Initialize all tables (including historical models)
init_db()
```

This creates all tables in the configured database (default: SQLite).

## Configuration

The system uses the existing database configuration from `config/settings.py`:

```python
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./capivara_bet.db"
# or
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname"
```

## Data Flow

1. **Population Scripts** → Collect raw data from APIs/scrapers
2. **Database Storage** → Store in normalized historical tables
3. **Pattern Calculator** → Analyze data to find profitable patterns
4. **Analytics Module** → Provide query functions for analysis
5. **Dashboard/Application** → Display insights and value bets

## Performance Considerations

- **Indexing**: Key columns are indexed (game_id, match_id, player_id, etc.)
- **Pagination**: Use pagination for large queries
- **Caching**: Analytics results can be cached for performance
- **Batch Processing**: Population scripts use batch commits

## Advanced Features

### Statistical Significance

Pattern calculator includes Z-score calculation for statistical significance:
- **HIGH confidence**: Z-score > 2.0, sample size > 20
- **MEDIUM confidence**: Z-score > 1.5, sample size > 10
- **LOW confidence**: Below thresholds

### ROI Calculation

Patterns track ROI based on actual hit rates and average odds:
```python
roi = ((hit_rate * avg_odds) - 1) * 100
```

### Trend Detection

Player props analysis includes trend detection:
- **UP**: Last 5 avg > Season avg
- **DOWN**: Last 5 avg < Season avg
- **STABLE**: Within 5% of season avg

## Extending the System

### Adding New Sports

1. Create models in `database/historical_models.py`
2. Create population script in `scripts/`
3. Add analytics functions in `analytics/betting_analytics.py`
4. Update pattern calculator

### Adding New Splits

1. Add columns to relevant model
2. Update population script to calculate split
3. Add analysis function for the split

## Integration with Existing System

The historical database integrates with the existing Capivara Bet system:

- **Scrapers**: Reuses ESPN, VLR, HLTV, and other scrapers
- **Database**: Extends existing database with new tables
- **Dashboard**: Can be visualized in Streamlit dashboard
- **Models**: Can feed into existing predictive models

## Example: Complete Workflow

```python
# 1. Initialize database
from database.db import init_db
init_db()

# 2. Populate data
import asyncio
from scripts.populate_nba_season import main as populate_nba
from scripts.populate_soccer_leagues import main as populate_soccer

asyncio.run(populate_nba())
asyncio.run(populate_soccer())

# 3. Calculate patterns
from scripts.calculate_patterns import main as calc_patterns
calc_patterns()

# 4. Analyze and find value
from analytics.betting_analytics import get_analytics

analytics = get_analytics()
props = analytics.get_player_prop_analysis("LeBron James", "points", 25.5)
btts = analytics.get_team_btts_analysis("Liverpool", "eng.1")
value_bets = analytics.get_value_bets("nba", min_edge=5.0)

print("LeBron Props:", props)
print("Liverpool BTTS:", btts)
print("Value Bets:", value_bets)

analytics.close()
```
